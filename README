Thank you for your interest on the code of Xspector.
The code is mainly on the file "Code". You should read the code as follow
    - isMail ( simple functions to simplify the reading)
    - classM ( Main structure of the code )
    - Setup ( What happens the first time we run the code )
    - Info  ( What happens next, main code of the app )
    - MCheck_3.3 ( How evrything is linked together )

    - webbot and Encryption files are not from me: credit goes to their creators
